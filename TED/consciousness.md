your brain hallucinates your concious reality 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyu7v7nWzfo&t=207s

brain uses expectations to change what we conciously experience 

examples
visual: block with a shadow same color as dark block without shadow

audio: hear a garbled audio clip: no idea 
after hearing un garbled the garbled is discernible 

hallucination: uncontrolled perception 
when we agree on hallucinations (as collective) then we call that reality 

neuroscience experiment:  
rubber hand illusion 
rubber hand stroked with paintbrush 
subject feels that the fake hand is in fact part of body 
subject must stare at the fake hand 
comedy: someone comes and stabs the fake hand with a fork 

perceiving body from inside 
we experience inside when something goes wrong 

"we predict ourselves into existence"
