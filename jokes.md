[Go Back](README.md)

A man escapes from prison after spending 15 years there.
he breaks into a home and finds a couple in bed.
he ties the man to a chair and ties the girl to the bed and gets on top of her kissing her neck
he then heads to the bathroom.
While in the bathroom the husband tells the wife.
"This guy is dangerous, he probably spent a long time in jail and hasn't had a woman
 in a long time.
I saw how he kissed your neck so he probably wants sex.  Just don't resist and
try to pretend you are enjoying it no matter how much it nauseates you.  if he gets
angry he may kill us.  be strong honey, i love you."
the wife responds, "he wasn't kissing my neck.  he was whispering me in my ear:
he said 'i'm gay', thinks you're cute, and asked me if we had any vaseline.
I said it was in the bathroom.
Be strong honey, I love you too!"

Husband always insisted on making love in the dark.
After 20 years wife turns on light and sees he is using vibrator.
"you impotent bastard!  how could you lie to me all the years?"
husband looks her in eyes and says: "i'll explain the toys, you explain the kids"

Little April was not the best student in Sunday school.
Usually she slept through the class.
One day the teacher called on her while she was napping, "Tell me, April, who created the universe?"
When April didn't stir, little Johnny, a boy seated in the chair behind her, took a pin and jabbed her in the rear.
"GOD ALMIGHTY!" shouted April and the teacher said, "Very good" and April fell back asleep.
A while later the teacher asked April, "Who is our Lord and Saviour," But, April didn't even stir from her slumber.
Once again, Johnny came to the rescue and stuck her again.
"JESUS CHRIST!" shouted April and the teacher said, "very good," and April fell back to sleep.
Then the teacher asked April a third question.
"What did Eve say to Adam after she had her twenty-third child?"
And again, Johnny jabbed her with the pin.
This time April jumped up and shouted, "IF YOU STICK THAT F*****G THING IN ME ONE MORE TIME, I'LL BREAK IT IN HALF AND STICK IT UP YOUR ARSE!"
The Teacher fainted.
